# Web-programming
In the projects, i had used **PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript &amp; Ajax**. 

Here is a brief introduction of those languages :

**PHP :** Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development.

**HTML :** Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.

**CSS :** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
For learning you can follow this site :

**JavaScript :** JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

**Ajax :** AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.
